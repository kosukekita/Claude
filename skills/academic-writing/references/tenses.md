# Using Tenses in Scientific Writing

> Based on the infographic by Editage (Cactus Communications)

---

## Introduction

In scientific writing, **tense usage depends upon the section of the paper** being written. Different sections of the **IMRaD format** (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) warrant the use of different tenses.

---

## Title

- Titles are often **not complete sentences**, i.e., no verb is used.
  - *Example:* "Fully device independent quantum key distribution"
- If you do want to use a complete sentence, use the **present tense**.
  - *Example:* "What your Facebook profile picture **reveals** about your personality"

## Introduction

A **mixture of tenses** is used in the introduction.

### Present Tense
Use when **stating general truths**.
> *Example:* "Many programmers **rely** on 3-way merge tools to integrate changes from different branches."

### Present Perfect Tense
Use when describing actions that **happened in the past but are still relevant today**.
> *Example:* "Classification analyses of various sorts **have been used** frequently for structuring document collections."

### Past Tense
Use when **discussing previous studies or past events**.
> *Example:* "Watson and Crick **published** their landmark paper on the structure of DNA in 1953."

---

## Methods

The **past tense** is mostly used in the methods section.

### Past Tense
Use when describing **what was done** in the study.
> *Example:* "The 3D convex hull model **was generated** by rotating around a central vertical axis at the center of the point cloud using Equation (1)."

Occasionally, the **past perfect tense** and **past continuous tense** are required.

---

## Results

A **mixture of tenses** is used in the results section.

### Past Tense
Use when **summarizing the findings/results** of the study.
> *Example:* "Antibiotic resistance **increased** over time."

### Present Tense
Use when **referencing figures/tables** in the text.
> *Example:* "Examples **are shown** in Table 1 and Fig. 2."

---

## Discussion

A **mixture of tenses** is used in the discussion section, including the past tense, the present tense, and the future tense.

### Past Tense
Use when **summarizing your own results or referring to previous studies**.
> *Example:* "Our results **showed** that the treatment was effective."

### Present Tense
Use when **interpreting results, discussing significance, and presenting conclusions**.
> *Example:* "Our data **suggest** this pathway may be responsible for..."

Use when **referencing figures/tables** in the text.
> *Example:* "Fig. 3 **shows** that..."

### Future Tense
Use when **discussing the implications of the study or future research directions**.
> *Example:* "Understanding these privacy norms **will allow** manufacturers to design devices that consumers are comfortable incorporating into their homes."
